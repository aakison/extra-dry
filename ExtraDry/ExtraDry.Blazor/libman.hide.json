/* Problem with Blazor client generation where the libman.json file gets included twice.  This 
   happens even if the file is not copied to output (some different pipeline?).  This is not 
   used during CI, files are checked in to prevent CDN issues blocking build.  So, this is just
   a reminder of what libraries are used and where they are.  

   Change the extension to update, then change back when done to prevent collisions.
